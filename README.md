# 🌌 Parallel Universe Simulator - MySQL Project

Welcome to the **Parallel Universe Simulator**, a deeply imaginative and data-driven MySQL project designed to simulate alternate realities for users. Each universe is a reflection of different decisions, events, and outcomes — mapped and analyzed using advanced SQL constructs.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

This MySQL-based project is divided into multiple interconnected tables and logic layers:

- 👤 `users`: Stores personal and psychological profiles.
- 🌍 `universes`: Represents parallel timelines for each user.
- 🧠 `life_choices`: Captures critical decisions and their impact.
- 🌠 `events`: Tracks consequences across five life metrics.
- ❤️ `relationships`: Models interactions and bond dynamics.
- 🧾 `universe_logs`: Records diary entries, reflections, or anomalies.
- 🏆 `achievements`: Tracks major milestones in each universe.
- 📊 `universe_summary`: SQL view summarizing metrics for each universe.

## 🔧 Core Features

✅ Create users with psychological traits  
✅ Build alternate universes from a divergence point  
✅ Log important life decisions with emotional context  
✅ Record events with impact on happiness, health, wealth, social life, and career  
✅ Manage dynamic relationships (romantic, rivalry, mentorship, etc.)  
✅ Prevent over-saturation of high-impact decisions (via Trigger)  
✅ View full universe timelines using a stored procedure  
✅ Evaluate universes via computed summaries
